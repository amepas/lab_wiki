# Lab Policies

## Confidentiality

Do not share information regarding current projects outside the lab. The rule is to not discuss ongoing projects with folks external to Vertaix, because we are a lab that just started and cannot afford scooping.

# Writing

For support on writing, especially academic or scientific writing, Princeton has a great resource called the Writing Center which is here to support you by providing workshops and opportunities to get feedback on your writing. For more information, please visit their website: https://writing.princeton.edu/ 

# Academic Twitter

Please follow the Vertaix Twitter account at: https://twitter.com/Vertaix_.

# Creating a Mini-Website

If you would like to create your own academic website, you can clone this repository: https://github.com/jonbarron/website

Once you have cloned it, feel free to add your own research projects and previous experience in your repository. Some additional sections you may want to add could include: Honors & Awards, Teaching, Leadership. 

# Thriving in Graduate School

These topics are generally related to how to have a great graduate school experience. 

## Mental Health & Self-Care

Maintaining a work-life balance is essential to having a positive graduate school experience. Though research and classes can get busy, always remember to leave some time for other activities you enjoy and that help to keep you happy and healthy. Also, remember to form a community of peers that will be with you throughout the ups and downs of your graduate program!

If you do experience mental health concerns and want to seek additional help, Princeton has a great, free counseling service for students (CPS). You can find details here: https://uhs.princeton.edu/counseling-psychological-services

Appointments may be scheduled via your MyUHS portal, under the "Appointments" tab. This counseling service is great for any short-term concerns, such as stress/anxiety, imposter syndrome, social life and relationships, etc. They also offer many group counseling sessions, which can be a great way to connect with others who share some aspects of your identity or experience and gain support together. 

For longer term therapy and off-campus providers, CPS can provide referrals to therapists that accept your Student Health Plan.
